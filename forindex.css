                Hello! Welcome to TomesProvocative, the home of a bunch of 
                friends/ enemies hanging out and writing eachother interesting

                <p>
                    On this site our main theme is a fantasy world named
                    Villahail. Due to our current technical abilities
                    if you have a story written out and ready to send
                    to our website please email it to me at 
                    <email>tomesprovocativeofficial@gmail.com</email>
                    . Soon though we will be able to upload it indipendently.
                    At the time I am writing this we have no lore, no history,
                    and nothing else so simply write what you wish into the world.
                    Though if any other article has been uploaded when you see this
                    please read it and don't contradict it when you upload
                    your addition to the lore.
                </p>
